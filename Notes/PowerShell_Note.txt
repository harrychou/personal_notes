Ch1 Before Begin
  to get the verison number of Powershell (if variable does not exist, assume v1)
    $psversiontable.psversion 

Ch2 Command
  
  some bash commands are available
    * but not all options are accepted (ex. Dir /s)
    * these commands are still implemented by PowerShell commandlet

  file system commands
    Dir/ls
    Copy/cp
    Cd
    Ren (rename file)
    Mkdir 
    RmDir
    Del/rm
    Type/cat (display content of a file)

  take away: some commands still work, but may behave differently than cmd.exe or bash

  PSDrives
    * have a unified way to view hierachical data store
      - file system
      - registry (hkcu: hklm:)
    * to show all PSDrives mapped
      Get-PSDrive
      (can be long drive name)
    * to map your own PSDrive
      New-PSDrive -name DEMO -psprovider FileSystem -root \\Server\Share\Folder
      (unfortunately, this is not available to Windows Explorer)

  How to execute external commands with a lot of parameters:
    
    $exe = "C:\Vmware\vcbMounter.exe"
    $host = "server"
    $user = "joe"
    $password = "password"
    $machine = "somepc"
    $location = "somelocation"
    $backupType = "incremental"

    & $exe -h $host -u $user -p $password -s "name:$machine" -r $location -t $backupType

    (& is the way to turn string to command and call on it)

  Powershell command map to external command

    Get-ChildItem (for Dir, Ls)
    Set-Location (for Cd)
    Move-Item (for Move)
    Rename-Item (for Ren)
    Remove-Item (for Del, Rm, RmDir)
    Copy-Item (for Copy, Cp)
    Get-Content (for Type, Cat)
    New-Item (for MkDir)

  Powershell has consistent naming for commands
    
    Display a list of services Get-Service
    Display a list of running processes Get-Process
    Display the contents of an event log Get-EventLog
    Create a new service New-Service
    Retrieve Exchange mailboxes Get-Mailbox
    Create a new Exchange mailbox New-Mailbox

Ch3 Help System

  Get-Help event 
    - get commands about event
    - you can use man or help 
      * function wrapper for Get-Help with filter of More
      * less typing, so very useful
    - Get-Help *Log*
      will display all commands with Log
      if only one match, will just display help for that command
    - Help *EventLog* will do the same thing as Get-Help

  Ctrl-C: break

  Get-Command
    - Gcm
    - only list for comdlets
    - Help is searching in help document

  Understanding Help
    - Parameters
      * Optional
      * Mandatory
        (Powershell will prompt you if you don't supply them)
    - A comdlet can have more than one set of parameters
    - most comdlet also accept a set of CommonParameters
      -Verbose
      -Debug
      -WarningAction
      -WarningVariable
      -ErrorAction
      -ErrorVariable
      -OutVariable
      -OutBuffer
    - Positional parameters
    - Best practice: spell out parameter names until you are familiar with the comdlet
    - Help .... -full 
      (to get full document instead of summary)
    - some parameters are switch type, you cannot provide value for it
      (either present or not)
    - type of parameter
      * String
      * Int/Int32/Int64
      * DateTime
        05-13-2013
      * string[]
        - provided by comma-separated strings
        - or read from other comdlet's output
          Get-EventLog Application -Computer (Get-Content list.txt)
          (very useful)
        - or for mandatory parameter just leave empty, the Powershell will prompt for it

  Access about topics
    - Help *common*

  Online help
    - Help Get-EventLog -online
