What is web api?
	- RPC over HTTP
		* HTTP verbs
		* URL, caching ... etc over HTTP
	- Restful
		* Resource URIs
		* HTTP Verbs
		* Stateless Servers (load balance possible, idenpotence - allow operations to be applied multiple times)
		* Content Negotiation (client decide the format)
	- HATEOAS: hypermedia as the engine of application state
		* Allow linking and form for furthur actions

Resource Based Architecture
	- thinking in terms of Resources
	- Resources can be nested
		* Employees/1/Timesheets
		* Timesheets/?dept=HR&start=2014-01-01&end=2014-02-01
	- Hierarchies or Document/Web-based, not relational model
	- Identified by URIs
		* use query string if needed

Be pragmatic about being Restful
	- It's good to conform to REST-style architecture principles
	- but conforming to it does not take away the need for client to learn about the business model and requirements
	- in many/most cases, REST is the right approach for providing API over http
