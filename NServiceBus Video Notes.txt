What's new with NServiceBus 3.0?
- basics of NServiceBus
- current release 2.6
- 3.0 goal: better out of box experience
	* more guildline/conventions
- agenda
	storage
	naming endpoints (key to 3.0)
	hadling time (timouts)
	bridge remote sites/apps
	random stuff

- what is bus anyway?
	common confusion: with broker
	bus is like ethernet
		- no centralized machine
		- it is everywhere, helping services talk to each other
		- has logical addresses (sperate from physical)
		- load balanace capability
	unlike eithernet
		- publish/subscribe
		- message ID
		- need to store things

- each endpoint need a storage
	- saga
	- subscriptions
	- timeouts
	- for distributers, keep track of available workers
	- retry (deduplication)

- need to scale out, shared storage

- 3.0 using RavenDB as storage
	bundled with NServiceBus
	still support NHibernate, but moved to other DLL
	easier to work with RavenDB
	fast, support transactions
