If it is my passion, why don't I do something about it?

1. participate in g0v project
2. translate more works under creative common
  for example: http://lesterland.lessig.org/pdf/republic-lost.pdf
3. read more about Lawrence Lessig's work
  http://lesterland.lessig.org/
4. study more about the philosophy of nonviolence civil disobedience
